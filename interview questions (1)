Data Types:

1.What are the basic data types in Python?

Answer: The basic data types in Python are integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, and None.

2.Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types.

Answer: Mutable data types can be modified after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries), while immutable data types cannot be changed (e.g., integers, strings, tuples).

3.How do you convert one data type to another in Python?

Answer: You can use functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), and others to convert between data types.

4.What is dynamic typing in Python?

Answer: Dynamic typing means that variable types are determined at runtime, allowing you to assign different data types to the same variable.

5.What is the None data type in Python, and how is it used?

Answer: None is a special data type representing the absence of a value. It is often used as a placeholder or to indicate that a variable has no value.

6.Explain the use of the is operator in Python.

Answer: The is operator checks if two variables reference the same object in memory. It returns True if they do and False otherwise.

Operators:

1.What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?

Answer: == checks if two values are equal, while is checks if two variables reference the same object in memory.

2.Explain the use of the ternary conditional operator x if condition else y.

Answer: It is a concise way to write an if-else statement. If the condition is True, it returns x; otherwise, it returns y.

3.What is operator overloading in Python?

Answer: Operator overloading allows you to define custom behavior for operators such as +, -, or * for user-defined classes.

4.How do you perform integer division in Python?

Answer: Integer division is performed using the // operator, which returns the floor of the division result as an integer.

5.What is the difference between / and // operators in Python?


Answer: / performs float division, while // performs integer division.

Conditional Statements:

1.Explain the if, elif, and else statements in Python.

Answer: if is used to test a condition, elif (short for "else if") is used for additional conditions, and else is the default if no previous conditions are met.

2.How do you write a nested if statement in Python?

Answer: You can place one if statement inside another to create a nested if statement.

3.What is the purpose of the pass statement in Python?

Answer: The pass statement is a placeholder used when no action is required. It allows you to have a syntactically correct empty block of code.

4.Explain the use of the assert statement.

Answer: The assert statement is used for debugging. It checks a condition and raises an exception if the condition is False.

5.What are the truthy and falsy values in Python?

Answer: In Python, values like non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, and non-empty containers are considered truthy, while 0, None, and empty objects are falsy.

Functions:

1.What is a function in Python, and how do you define one?

Answer: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. You can define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.

2.Explain the difference between parameters and arguments in a function.

Answer: Parameters are placeholders in the function definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.

3.What is a default argument in Python functions?

Answer: A default argument is a parameter with a predefined value. If no value is provided for that parameter when calling the function, the default value is used.

4.How do you return multiple values from a function in Python?

Answer: You can return multiple values from a function by packing them into a tuple, list, or another data structure, and then unpacking them when calling the function.

5.Explain the concept of scope and namespaces in Python functions.

Answer: Scope defines the region where a variable is accessible, and namespaces are containers that store variable names and their values. Python has local, enclosing, global, and built-in scopes.

6.What is a lambda function in Python, and how is it used?

Answer: A lambda function is an anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It is typically used for small, simple operations and can be passed as an argument to higher-order functions like map, filter, and sorted.

Looping Statements:

1.What is the purpose of the break and continue statements in loops?

Answer: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, while the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.

2.Explain the for loop in Python.

Answer: The for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string). It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

3.Explain the while loop in Python.

Answer: The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is True.

4.How do you iterate through a dictionary using loops in Python?

Answer: You can iterate through a dictionary using a for loop, typically by using the items() method.

5.What are the differences between the for loop and the while loop in Python?

Answer: The main difference is that the for loop is used for iterating over a sequence, while the while loop is used for executing code as long as a condition is True.
